Phases: Weather Modeling Using Waterfall Model
1. Requirement Analysis

Team Member 1: Data Acquisition

Gather all data sources required for weather modelling

Collect weather parameters such as:

Temperature

Humidity (optional)

Identify reliable historical weather data sources

Specify quadratic model requirements

Define desired outputs (predicted weather values)

2. Design

Team Member 3: Model Formulation (Lead)

Design the overall system architecture

Mathematical representation of the quadratic model:

y = ax² + bx + c

Define meaning of variables and coefficients

Design data structures for storing input and output

Prepare flowcharts for system execution

3. Data Preprocessing

Team Member 2: Data Preprocessing

Clean the collected weather data

Remove missing or incorrect values

Convert data into numerical format

Normalize data if required

Prepare final dataset for model implementation

4. Implementation (Coding)

Team Member 4: Implementation

Code the quadratic weather model

Use a chosen programming language (Python)

Implement quadratic equation logic

Integrate required libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib)

Perform unit testing during implementation

5. Verification / Testing

Team Member 5: Testing

Test model predictions against historical weather data

Compare predicted values with actual values

Verify correctness of the model

Identify and fix errors

6. Deployment

Deliver the final weather modelling system for usage

Ensure successful execution of the program

Make the system available to users

7. Maintenance

Periodically check system performance

Update the model coefficients when new data is available

Improve prediction accuracy

Fix minor issues and enhance functionality
